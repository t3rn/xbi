[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/t3rn/xbi/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=PKR69NFU6U)](https://codecov.io/gh/t3rn/xbi)

An XCM-based high-level standard and interface (ABI) for smart contracts.

## W3F grants

At t3rn, we aim for XBI to become the de-facto standord for integrating with smart contracts all cross the ecosystem. 
To facilitate that, we aim to implement XBI as a set of grants to enable a transparent, usable specification. 

## Standards

The XBI standard is undergoing a lot of iteration, the details can be found in ./docs.

- The opening proposal is [here](./docs/xbi-w3f-grant.md), with the PSP for such [here](./docs/PSP-33-XBI-Standard.md)

### XBI Extensions

Whilst XBI should be modular, so should extensions on XBI. Each extension can be roughly explained here, and any links to the 
grant proposals seen below:
